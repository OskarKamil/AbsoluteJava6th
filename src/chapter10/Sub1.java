 * Stream is like a tunnel that text can flow though. It can be from keyboard or
 * from a text file, and it can be onto screen or a file too. The class Scanner
 * is used for both reading, it can be from a file or from a keyboard. Text
 * files are files that can be edited by humans using text editor. And they are
 * readable by humans too. Binary file is not readable by human because it is
 * encoded and usually to write and read this file you need a program that can
 * read it. It is usually a program that created it file.
