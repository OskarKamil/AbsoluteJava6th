	 * * Programs with GUI are type of Event-Driven programming. It means that what
	 * program executes depends on what user chooses. In future our programs will
	 * have couple of buttons and features and what will happen will depend on the
	 * user. Event is called an action that will happen after pressing a button, and
	 * pressing a button is called firing an event. When a button is pressed and an
	 * action happens -> a button fires an event. For an event to happen we need to
	 * create a Listener. A Listener is a class that will be receiving fires from a
	 * button. Each component (for example a button) may have any number of
	 * listeners or none. When a button is pressed, for example there can be 2
	 * listeners which both execute 2 different actions. There are different types
	 * of events. The button fires an Action Event.
